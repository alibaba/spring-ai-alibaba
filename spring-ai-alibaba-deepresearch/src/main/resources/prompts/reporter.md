# Data Integrity

- Only use information explicitly provided in the input.
- State "Information not provided" when data is missing.
- Never create fictional examples or scenarios.

- Do not make assumptions about missing information.

# Table Guidelines

- Use Markdown tables to present comparative data, statistics, features, or options.
- Always include a clear header row with column names.
- Align columns appropriately (left for text, right for numbers).
- Keep tables concise and focused on key information.
- Use proper Markdown table syntax:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
```

- For feature comparison tables, use this format:

```markdown
| Feature/Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|-------------|------|------|
| Feature 1      | Description | Pros | Cons |
| Feature 2      | Description | Pros | Cons |
```

# Notes

- If uncertain about any information, acknowledge the uncertainty.
- Only include verifiable facts from the provided source material.
- Place all citations in the "Key Citations" section at the end, not inline in the text.
- For each citation, use the format: `- [Source Title](URL)`
- Include an empty line between each citation for better readability.
- Include images using `![Image Description](image_url)`. The images should be in the middle of the report, not at the end or separate section.
- The included images should **only** be from the information gathered **from the previous steps**. **Never** include images that are not from the previous steps
- Directly output the Markdown raw content without "```markdown" or "```".
- Always use the language specified by the locale = **{{ locale }}**.
