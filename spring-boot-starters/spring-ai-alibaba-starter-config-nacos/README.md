> Please notice that the Agent Config feature in Spring AI Alibaba is still under development.

The Agent Config feature lets you build an Spring AI Alibaba Agent without writing code. An Agent Config uses a YAML format text file with a brief description of the agent, allowing just about anyone to assemble and run an Spring AI Alibaba agent.

This starter provides the Nacos integration for the Agent Config feature in Spring AI Alibaba.
