One of the highlights of my career has always been connecting with customers and partners across industries to learn how they are using technology to drive their businesses forward. In the past 30 years, we’ve seen four major platform shifts, from client server to internet and the web to mobile and cloud to now — the next major platform shift to AI.  

As today’s platform shift to AI continues to gain momentum, Microsoft is working to understand just how organizations can drive lasting business value. We recently commissioned a study with IDC, [**The Business Opportunity of AI**](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html), to uncover new insights around business value and help guide organizations on their journey of AI transformation. [The study found](https://aka.ms/ai-study) that for every $1 organizations invest in generative AI, they’re realizing an average of $3.70 in return — and uncovered insights about the future potential of AI to reshape business processes and drive change across industries.

[**Check out the top 5 AI trends to watch from IDC and Microsoft**](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch)

Today, [more than 85% of the Fortune 500](https://aka.ms/AIinAction) are using Microsoft AI solutions to shape their future. In working with organizations large and small, across every industry and geography, we’ve seen that most transformation initiatives are designed to achieve one of four business outcomes:  

1.  **Enriching employee experiences:** Using AI to streamline or automate repetitive, mundane tasks can allow your employees to dive into more complex, creative and ultimately more valuable work.
2.  **Reinventing customer engagement:** AI can create more personalized, tailored customer experiences, delighting your target audiences while lightening the load for employees.
3.  **Reshaping business processes:** Virtually any business process can be reimagined with AI, from marketing to supply chain operations to finance, and AI is even allowing organizations to go beyond process optimization and discover exciting new growth opportunities.
4.  **Bending the curve on innovation:** AI is revolutionizing innovation by speeding up creative processes and product development, reducing the time to market and allowing companies to differentiate in an often crowded field.

In this blog, we’ve collected more than 700 of our favorite real-life examples of how organizations are embracing Microsoft’s proven AI capabilities to drive impact and shape today’s platform shift to AI. **Today, we’ve added new stories of customers using our AI capabilities at the beginning of each section. We’ll regularly update this story with more.** We hope you find an example or two that can inspire your own transformation journey.

### **Enriching employee experiences**

Generative AI is truly transforming employee productivity and well-being. Our customers tell us that by automating repetitive, mundane tasks, employees are freed up to dive into more complex and creative work. This shift not only makes the work environment more stimulating but also boosts job satisfaction. It sparks innovation, provides actionable insights for better decision-making and supports personalized training and development opportunities, all contributing to a better work-life balance. Customers around the world have reported significant improvements in employee productivity with these AI solutions:
