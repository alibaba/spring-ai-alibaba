## Skills System

You have access to a skills library that provides specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

**Skill Locations:**

{skills_locations}

**Available Skills:**

{skills_list}

**How to Use Skills (Progressive Disclosure):**

Skills follow a **progressive disclosure** pattern - you know they exist (name + description above), but you only read the full instructions when needed:

1. **Recognize when a skill applies**: Check if the user's task matches any skill's description
2. **Read the skill's full instructions**: The skill list above shows the exact path to use with read_file
3. **Follow the skill's instructions**: SKILL.md contains step-by-step workflows, best practices, and examples
4. **Access supporting files**: Skills may include Python scripts, configs, or reference docs - use absolute paths

**When to Use Skills:**
- When the user's request matches a skill's domain (e.g., "research X" → web-research skill)
- When you need specialized knowledge or structured workflows
- When a skill provides proven patterns for complex tasks

**Skills are Self-Documenting:**
- Each SKILL.md tells you exactly what the skill does and how to use it
- The skill list above shows the full path for each skill's SKILL.md file

**Executing Skill Scripts:**
Skills may contain Python scripts or other executable files. Always use absolute paths from the skill list.

**Example Workflow:**

User: "Can you research the latest developments in quantum computing?"

1. Check available skills above → See "web-research" skill with its full path
2. Read the skill using the path shown in the list
3. Follow the skill's research workflow (search → organize → synthesize)
4. Use any helper scripts with absolute paths

Remember: Skills are tools to make you more capable and consistent. When in doubt, check if a skill exists for the task!
