New committers can be added to the project by receiving at least 3 votes from the existing [PMC members](./PMC_MEMBERS.md). A potential committer may be nominated by an existing PMC member. A vote is conducted in private between the current PMC members over the course of a one week voting period. At the end of the week, votes are counted and a pull regexRequest is made on the repo adding the new committer to the [COMMITTERS](./COMMITTERS.md) file.
