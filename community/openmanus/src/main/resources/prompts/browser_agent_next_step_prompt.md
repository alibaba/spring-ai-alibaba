What should I do next to achieve my goal?

When you see [Current state starts here], focus on the following:
- Current URL and page title:
{url_placeholder}

- Available tabs:
{tabs_placeholder}

- Interactive elements and their indices:
{interactive_elements}

- Content above {content_above_placeholder} or below {content_below_placeholder} the viewport (if indicated)

- Any action results or errors:
{results_placeholder}


Remember:
1. Use 'get_text' action to obtain page content instead of scrolling
2. Don't worry about content visibility or viewport position
3. Focus on text-based information extraction
4. Process the obtained text data directly
5. IMPORTANT: You MUST use at least one tool in your response to make progress!


Consider both what's visible and what might be beyond the current viewport.
Be methodical - remember your progress and what you've learned so far.
