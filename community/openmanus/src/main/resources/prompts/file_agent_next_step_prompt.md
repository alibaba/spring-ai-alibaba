What should I do next to achieve my goal?

Current File Operation State:
- Working Directory: {working_directory}
- Last File Operation: {last_operation}
- Last Operation Result: {operation_result}


Remember:
1. Check file existence before operations
2. Handle different file types appropriately
3. Validate file paths and content
4. Keep track of file operations
5. Handle potential errors
6. IMPORTANT: You MUST use at least one tool in your response to make progress!

Think step by step:
1. What file operation is needed?
2. Which tool is most appropriate?
3. How to handle potential errors?
4. What's the expected outcome?
