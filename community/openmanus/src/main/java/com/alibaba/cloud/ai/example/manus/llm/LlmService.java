			+ "This document provides guidance on creating effective prompts when working with AI assistants. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of responses you receive.\n\n"
			+ "## Key Elements of Effective Prompts\n\n" + "### Be specific and Clear\n"
			+ "- State your request explicitly\n" + "- Include relevant context and background information\n"
			+ "- Specify the format you want for the response\n" + "- Mention any constraints or requirements\n\n"
			+ "### Provide Context\n" + "- Explain why you need the information\n"
			+ "- Share relevant background knowledge\n" + "- Mention previous attempts if applicable\n"
			+ "- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic\n\n" + "### Structure Your Request\n"
			+ "- Break complex requests into smaller parts\n" + "- Use numbered lists for multi-part questions\n"
			+ "- Prioritize information if asking for multiple things\n"
			+ "- Consider using headers or sections for organization\n\n" + "### Specify Output Format\n"
			+ "- Indicate preferred response length (brief vs. detailed)\n"
			+ "- Request specific formats (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)\n"
			+ "- Mention if you need code examples, citations, or other special elements Specify tone and style if relevant (formal, conversational, technical)\n\n"
			+ "## Example Prompts\n\n" + "### Poor Prompt:\n" + "\"Tell me about machine learning.\n\n"
			+ "### Improved Prompt:\n"
			+ "\"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm examples with their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n"
			+ "### Poor Prompt:\n" + "\"Write code for a website.\n\n" + "### Improved Prompt:\n"
			+ "\"I need to create a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should validate inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme.\n\n"
			+ "# Iterative Prompting\n\n"
			+ "Remember that working with AI assistants is often an iterative process:\n\n"
			+ "1. Start with an initial prompt\n" + "2. Review the response\n"
			+ "3. Refine your prompt based on what was helpful or missing\n"
			+ "4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further\n\n" + "# When Prompting for code\n\n"
			+ "When requesting code examples, consider including:\n\n" + "- Programming language and version\n"
			+ "- Libraries or frameworks you're using\n" + "- Error messages if troubleshooting\n"
			+ "- Sample input/output examples\n" + "- Performance considerations\n" + "- Compatibility requirements\n\n"
			+ "# Conclusion\n\n"
			+ "Effective prompting is a skill that develops with practice. By being clear, specific, and providing context, you can get more valuable and relevant responses from AI assistants. Remember that you can always refine your prompt if the initial response doesn't fully address your needs.\n\n"

			You are OpenManus, an all-capable AI assistant, aimed at solving any task presented by the user. You have various tools at your disposal that you can call upon to efficiently complete complex requests. Whether it's programming, information retrieval, file processing, or web browsing, you can handle it all.

			You can interact with the computer using PythonExecute, save important content and information files through FileSaver, open browsers with BrowserUseTool, and retrieve information using GoogleSearch.

			PythonExecute: Execute Python code to interact with the computer system, data processing, automation tasks, etc.

			FileSaver: Save files locally, such as txt, py, html, etc.

			BrowserUseTool: Open, browse, and use web browsers.If you open a local HTML file, you must provide the absolute path to the file.

			Terminate : Record  the result summary of the task , then terminate the task.

			DocLoader: List all the files in a directory or get the content of a local file at a specified path. Use this tool when you want to get some related information at a directory or file asked by the user.

			Based on user needs, proactively select the most appropriate tool or combination of tools. For complex tasks, you can break down the problem and use different tools step by step to solve it. After using each tool, clearly explain the execution results and suggest the next steps.

			When you are done with the task, you can finalize the plan by summarizing the steps taken and the output of each step, call Terminate tool to record the result.
